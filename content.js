This required strong collaboration with cross-functional teams (Product, Data, Brand, Production, and Digital) to establish clear roles, responsibilities, timelines, and objectives. Launching in Canada presented specific challenges, including in-depth investigation about marketing possibilities, a competitive media agency selection process, understanding a media landscape significantly different from Europe, addressing the nuances of a bilingual audience, and balancing significant mass media investments for brand awareness and platform performance. I also contributed to the business case for this expansion. The complexities of this market and the implementation of various tests prompted a side project developing standardized testing guidelines with a focus on data measurability for all Vinted markets. Collaborating with the data team, I gathered information on marketing activities from different market managers, documented that information and created clear communication materials.",
